CollabSphere is a place where people can collaborate and work together, thereby enhancing skills and increasing network.
But why use it then, as we have websites like Upwork to handle that?
So, our websites mainly targets introverts, ambiverts and college freshmen, who are not so open to everyone, which eventually prevents them from showing their skills.
Also, this website reduces the overall time a person usually takes to find a member for projects, as one doesn't have to search the whole LinkedIn of a random person, find their GitHub from hours of research and then might get a good collaborator.
Our website just brings everything at one place, therefore allowing people to save their time and get better contributors.

Special features: -
1)Search Bar: It allows the user to search people based on the ID (usually the college ID) which allows them to view the profiles of their batchmates, seniors and juniors, much quickly and efficiently, and accordingly contact them for collaborations and help.
2)Project enrollment system: For an Introvert / college freshy, creating a proposal for joining, could be a difficult task.
To ease that process, users at college level can use our system to find and request to add themselves as collaborators. The creator can go through their GitHub and LinkedIn accounts and approve or reject the collab request.
3)Leaderboard: To keep users motivated, points will be rewarded on users on each acceptance of the collab request. On further development of the project, more parameters would be added.
4)Communities: To ease users find people having interest or experience in a field in a community, we have created different communities like Machine leaning, Blockchain, etc.
5)Links of profile could be provided: CollabSphere facilitates the user to share the link of the profile, like GitHub or LinkedIn.
